Package: debhelper
Description-md5: c3d35229c1ce392f77324206e097b92e
Description-en: helper programs for debian/rules
 A collection of programs that can be used in a debian/rules file to
 automate common tasks related to building Debian packages. Programs
 are included to install various files into your package, compress
 files, fix file permissions, integrate your package with the Debian
 menu system, debconf, doc-base, etc. Most Debian packages use debhelper
 as part of their build process.

Package: devscripts
Description-md5: 18712bf96fd125498747f0e7e056e01f
Description-en: scripts to make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier
 Contains the following scripts, dependencies/recommendations shown in
 brackets afterwards:
 .
  - annotate-output: run a command and prepend time and stream (O for stdout,
    E for stderr) for every line of output.
  - archpath: Prints arch (tla/Bazaar) package names. Also supports
    calculating the package names for other branches. [tla | bazaar]
  - bts: A command-line tool for accessing the Debian Bug Tracking System, both
    to send mails to control@bts.debian.org and to access the web pages and
    SOAP interface of the BTS. [www-browser, libauthen-sasl-perl,
    libnet-smtps-perl, libsoap-lite-perl, liburi-perl, libwww-perl,
    bsd-mailx | mailx]
  - build-rdeps: Searches for all packages that build-depend on a given package.
    [dctrl-tools, dose-extra, libdpkg-perl]
  - chdist: tool to easily play with several distributions. [dctrl-tools]
  - checkbashisms: check whether a /bin/sh script contains any common
    bash-specific constructs.
  - cowpoke: upload a Debian source package to a cowbuilder host and build it,
    optionally also signing and uploading the result to an incoming queue.
    [ssh-client]
  - cvs-debi, cvs-debc: wrappers around debi and debc respectively (see below)
    which allow them to be called from the CVS working directory.
    [cvs-buildpackage]
  - cvs-debrelease: wrapper around debrelease which allows it to be called
    from the CVS working directory. [cvs-buildpackage, dupload | dput,
    ssh-client]
  - cvs-debuild: A wrapper for cvs-buildpackage to use debuild as its package
    building program. [cvs-buildpackage, fakeroot, lintian, gnupg |gnupg2]
  - dcmd: run a given command replacing the name of a .changes or .dsc file
    with each of the files referenced therein. *
  - dd-list: given a list of packages, pretty-print it ordered by maintainer. *
  - debbisect: bisect snapshot.debian.org to find which change in the archive
    introduced a certain problem. [mmdebstrap, python3-debian]
  - debc: List contents of current package.  Do this after a successful
    "debuild" to see if the package looks all right.
  - debchange (abbreviation dch): Modifies debian/changelog and manages version
    numbers for you.  It will either increment the version number or add an
    entry for the current version, depending upon the options given to it.
    [libdistro-info-perl, libsoap-lite-perl]*
  - debcheckout: checkout the development repository of a Debian package. *
  - debclean: Clean a Debian source tree.  Debclean will clean all Debian
    source trees below the current directory, and if requested, also remove
    all files that were generated from these source trees (that is .deb, .dsc
    and .changes files).  It will keep the .diffs and original files, though,
    so that the binaries and other files can be rebuilt if necessary.
    [fakeroot]*
  - debcommit: Commits changes to cvs, darcs, svn, svk, tla, bzr, git, or hg,
    using new entries in debian/changelog as the commit message. Also supports
    tagging Debian package releases. [cvs | darcs | subversion | svk | tla |
    bzr | git-core | mercurial, libtimedate-perl]
  - debdiff: A program which examines two .deb files or two .changes files and
    reports on any difference found in their file lists.  Useful for ensuring
    that no files were inadvertently lost between versions.  Can also examine
    two .dsc files and report on the changes between source versions.
    For a deeper comparison one can use the diffoscope package.
    [wdiff, patchutils]*
  - debdiff-apply: Apply unified diffs of two Debian source packages, such as
    those generated by debdiff, to a target Debian source package. Any changes
    to debian/changelog are dealt with specially, to avoid the conflicts that
    changelog diffs typically produce when applied naively. May be used to check
    that old patches still apply to newer versions of those packages.
    [python3-debian, python3-unidiff, quilt]
  - debi: Installs the current package by using the setuid root debpkg
    script described below.  It assumes that the current package has
    just been built (for example by debuild), and the .deb lives in the
    parent directory, and will effectively run dpkg -i on the .deb.  The
    ability to install the package with a very short command is very
    useful when troubleshooting packages.
  - debootsnap: Combines debootstrap and snapshot.debian.org to create a chroot
    containing exactly the requested selection of packages. This can be used
    to re-create a chroot from the past, for example to reproduce a bug. The
    tool is also used by debrebuild to build a package in a chroot with build
    dependencies in the same version as recorded in the buildinfo file.
    [python3-pycurl, mmdebstrap]
  - debpkg: A wrapper for dpkg used by debi to allow convenient testing
    of packages.  For debpkg to work, it needs to be made setuid root,
    and this needs to be performed by the sysadmin -- it is not
    installed as setuid root by default.  (Note that being able to run a
    setuid root debpkg is effectively the same as having root access to
    the system, so this should be done with caution.)  Having debpkg as
    a wrapper for dpkg can be a Good Thing (TM), as it decreases the
    potential for damage by accidental wrong use of commands in
    superuser mode (e.g., an inadvertent rm -rf * in the wrong directory
    is disastrous as many can attest to).
  - debrelease: A wrapper around dupload or dput which figures out which
    version to upload, and then calls dupload or dput to actually perform
    the upload. [dupload | dput, ssh-client]
  - debrebuild: A script that provided a .buildinfo file reports the
    instructions on how to try to reproduce the reported build.
    [sbuild | mmdebstrap, python3-pycurl, libdpkg-perl]
  - debrepro: A script that tests reproducibility of Debian packages. It will
    build a given source directory twice, with a set of variation between the
    first and second build, and compare the binary packages produced. If
    diffoscope is installed, it is used to compare non-matching binaries. If
    disorderfs is installed, it is used during the build to inject
    non-determinism in filesystem listing operations.
    [faketime, diffoscope, disorderfs]
  - debrsign: This transfers a .changes/.dsc pair to a remote machine for
    signing, and runs debsign on the remote machine over an SSH connection.
    [gnupg | gnupg2, debian-keyring, ssh-client]
  - debsign: Use GNU Privacy Guard to sign the changes (and possibly dsc)
    files created by running dpkg-buildpackage with no-sign options.  Useful
    if you are building a package on a remote machine and wish to sign it on
    a local one.  This script is capable of automatically downloading the
    .changes and .dsc files from a remote machine. [gnupg |gnupg2,
    debian-keyring, ssh-client]*
  - debsnap: grab packages from https://snapshot.debian.org [libwww-perl,
    libjson-perl]
  - debuild: A wrapper for building a package (i.e., dpkg-buildpackage) to
    avoid problems with insufficient permissions and wrong paths etc.
    Debuild will set up the proper environment for building a package.
    Debuild will use the fakeroot program to build the package by default, but
    can be instructed to use any other gain-root command, or can even be
    installed setuid root.  Debuild can also be used to run various of
    the debian/rules operations with the same root-gaining procedure.
    Debuild will also run lintian to check that the package does not
    have any major policy violations. [fakeroot, lintian, gnupg | gnupg2]*

  - deb-reversion: increases a binary package version number and repacks the

    closed in the latest changelog as pending. [libsoap-lite-perl]
  - transition-check: Check a list of source packages for involvement in
    transitions for which uploads to unstable are currently blocked.
    [libwww-perl, libyaml-syck-perl]
  - uscan: Automatically scan for and download upstream updates.  Uscan can
    also call a program such as uupdate to attempt to update the Debianised
    version based on the new update.  Whilst uscan could be used to release
    the updated version automatically, it is probably better not to without
    testing it first.  Uscan can also verify detached OpenPGP signatures if
    upstream's signing key is known. [file, gpgv | gpgv2, gnupg | gnupg2,
    libfile-dirlist-perl, libfile-touch-perl, libfile-which-perl,
