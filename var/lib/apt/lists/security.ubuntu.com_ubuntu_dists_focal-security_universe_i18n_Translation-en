Package: acmetool
Description-md5: 3e5e145ae880b97f3b6e825daf35ce32
Description-en: automatic certificate acquisition tool for Let's Encrypt
 acmetool is an easy-to-use command line tool for automatically
 acquiring TLS certificates from ACME (Automated Certificate Management
 Environment) servers such as Let's Encrypt, designed to flexibly
 integrate into your webserver setup to enable automatic verification.
 .
 acmetool is designed to work like make: you specify what certificates
 you want, and acmetool obtains certificates as necessary to satisfy
 those requirements. If the requirements are already satisfied,
 acmetool doesn't do anything when invoked. Thus, acmetool is
 ideally suited for use on a cron job; it will do nothing until
 certificates are near expiry, and then obtain new ones.
 .
 acmetool is designed to minimise the use of state and be transparent
 in the state that it does use. All state, including certificates, is
 stored in a single directory, by default /var/lib/acme. The schema
 for this directory is simple, comprehensible and documented.

Package: aide-dynamic
Description-md5: 3c085f51d721d7dcb93bb05d2c714096
Description-en: Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment - dynamic binary
 AIDE is an intrusion detection system that detects changes to files on
 the local system. It creates a database from the regular expression rules
 that it finds from the config file. Once this database is initialized
 it can be used to verify the integrity of the files. It has several
 message digest algorithms (md5, sha1, rmd160, tiger, haval, etc.) that are
 used to check the integrity of the file. More algorithms can be added
 with relative ease. All of the usual file attributes can also be checked
 for inconsistencies.
 .
 This package contains a dynamically linked binary and should only be
 used in exeptional circumstances. To avoid exposure to trojaned
 libraries, it is advised to use one of the statically linked binaries.

Package: amanda-client
Description-md5: eb340217bc77fc442e67d6d525d8c0fb
Description-en: Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver (Client)
 Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a
 network to a single large-capacity tape drive. This package is
 suitable for large amounts of data to backup. For smaller solutions
 take a look at afbackup, tob, ...
 .
  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as they can be can written to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
   * lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.

Description-md5: da4b23920a85356ff3a27154c8159a99
Description-en: the digital audio workstation
 Ardour is a multichannel hard disk recorder (HDR) and digital audio
 workstation (DAW).  It can be used to control, record, edit and run
 complex audio setups.
 .
 Ardour supports pro-audio interfaces
 through the ALSA project, which provides high quality, well designed
 device drivers and API's for audio I/O under Linux. Any interface
 supported by ALSA can be used with Ardour. This includes the
 all-digital 26 channel RME Hammerfall, the Midiman Delta 1010 and many
 others.
 .
 Ardour has support for 24 bit samples
 using floating point internally, non-linear editing with unlimited undo,
 a user-configurable mixer, MTC master/slave capabilities, MIDI hardware
 control surface compatibility.
 .
 It supports MIDI
 Machine Control, and so can be controlled from any MMC controller and
 many modern digital mixers.
 .
 Ardour contains a
 powerful multitrack audio editor/arranger that is completely
 non-destructive and capable of all standard non-linear editing
 operations (insert, replace, delete, move, trim, select,
 cut/copy/paste). The editor has unlimited undo/redo capabilities and can
 save independent "versions" of a track or an entire piece
 .
 Ardour's editor supports the community-developed LADSPA
 plugin standard.  Arbitrary chains of plugins can be attached to any
 portion of a track.  Every mixer strip can have any number of inputs
 and outputs, not just mono, stereo or 5.1.  An N-way panner is
 included, with support for various panning models.  Pre- and post-fader
 sends exist, each with their own gain and pan controls.  Every mixer
 strip acts as its own bus, and thus the bus count in Ardour is
 unlimited.  You can submix any number of strips into another
 strip.
 .
 Ardour's channel capacity is limited only
 by the number on your audio interface and the ability of your disk
 subsystem to stream the data back and forth.
 .
 JACK
 (the JACK Audio Connection Kit) is used for all audio I/O, permitting
 data to be exchanged in perfect samplesync with other applications
 and/or hardware audio interfaces.
 .
 Ardour is
 sample rate and size neutral - any hardware formats from 8 to 32 bits,
 and rates from 8kHz to 192kHz.  Internal processing in 32/64 bit IEEE
 floating point format.

Package: ctdb
Description-md5: 83dff66615250b53a0cd3df6fb3b9ea7
Description-en: clustered database to store temporary data
 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Description-en: Application deployment framework for desktop apps
 Flatpak installs, manages and runs sandboxed desktop application bundles.
 Application bundles run partially isolated from the wider system, using
 containerization techniques such as namespaces to prevent direct access
 to system resources. Resources from outside the sandbox can be accessed
 via "portal" services, which are responsible for access control; for
 example, the Documents portal displays an "Open" dialog outside the
 sandbox, then allows the application to access only the selected file.
 .
 Each application uses a specified "runtime", or set of libraries, which is
 available as /usr inside its sandbox. This can be used to run application
 bundles with multiple, potentially incompatible sets of dependencies within
 the same desktop environment.

 A QR Code is a matrix (two-dimensional) barcode. Arbitrary content may
 be encoded, with URLs being a popular choice :)
 .
 Each QR Code contains error recovery information to aid reading damaged
 or obscured codes. There are four levels of error recovery: Low, medium,
 high and highest. QR Codes with a higher recovery level are more robust
 to damage, at the cost of being physically larger.
 .
 The maximum capacity of a QR Code varies according to the content encoded
 and the error recovery level. The maximum capacity is 2,953 bytes, 4,296
 alphanumeric characters, 7,089 numeric digits, or a combination of these.

Description-en: Go programming language compiler - metapackage
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and
 efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
 that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its
 novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.
 Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of
 garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a
 dynamically typed, interpreted language.

Description-en: library for running and interacting with trusted collections
 Notary is a project that allows anyone to have trust over arbitrary
 collections of data.
 .
 The Notary project comprises a server (cmd/notary-server) and a client
 (cmd/notary) for running and interacting with trusted collections.
 .
 Notary aims to make the internet more secure by making it easy for people to
 publish and verify content. We often rely on TLS to secure our communications
 with a web server which is inherently flawed, as any compromise of the server
 enables malicious content to be substituted for the legitimate content.
 .
 With Notary, publishers can sign their content offline using keys kept highly
 secure. Once the publisher is ready to make the content available, they can
 push their signed trusted collection to a Notary Server.
 .
 Consumers, having acquired the publisher's public key through a secure
 channel, can then communicate with any notary server or (insecure) mirror,
 relying only on the publisher's key to determine the validity and integrity
 of the received content.
 .

 This library supports using the Dockerfile syntax to build OCI & Docker
 compatible images, without invoking a container build command such
 as buildah bud or docker build. It is intended to give clients more
 control over how they build container images, including:
  - Instead of building one layer per line, run all instructions in the
    same container
  - Set HostConfig settings like network and memory controls that are
    not available when running container builds
  - Mount external files into the build that are not persisted as part
    of the final image (i.e. "secrets")
  - If there are no RUN commands in the Dockerfile, the container is
    created and committed, but never started.  The final image should be
    99.9% compatible with regular container builds, but bugs are always
    possible.

Package: gosu
Description-md5: 72c0b42347139534207936c653f27fc4
Description-en: Simple Go-based setuid+setgid+setgroups+exec
 This is a simple tool grown out of the simple fact that "su" and "sudo" have
 very strange and often annoying TTY and signal-forwarding behavior. They're
 also somewhat complex to setup and use (especially in the case of "sudo"),
 which allows for a great deal of expressivity, but falls flat if all you need
 is "run this specific application as this specific user and get out of the
 pipeline".
 .
 The core of how "gosu" works is stolen directly from how Docker/libcontainer
 itself starts an application inside a container (and in fact, is using the
 "/etc/passwd" processing code directly from libcontainer's codebase).
 .
 Once the user/group is processed, we switch to that user, then we "exec" the
 specified process and "gosu" itself is no longer resident or involved in the
 process lifecycle at all. This avoids all the issues of signal passing and TTY,
 and punts them to the process invoking "gosu" and the process being invoked by
 "gosu", where they belong.

 but there are many other platforms that this will work for, like
 embedded Linux OSes.  This gpgv in combination with debootstrap and
 the Debian archive keyring allows the secure creation of chroot
 installs on these platforms by using the full Debian signature
 verification that is present in all official Debian mirrors.

Package: graphicsmagick
Description-md5: 49dce754c724afc2a734936e7250be4b
Description-en: collection of image processing tools
 GraphicsMagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate
 image files. It is a fork of the ImageMagick project and therefore offers
 a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.
 .
 The tools support a large variety of image formats from the widely used
 jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or image
 formats found on some photo CDs. They can convert between formats,
 concatenate several images into one, annotate and distort them, create
 thumbnails or manipulate the colormap. While all features are available
 from the command-line, the package also includes an image viewer that
 allows interactive manipulation.
 .
 Note that unlike ImageMagick, the GraphicsMagick tools are accessed
 through a single executable called 'gm'. Therefore, GraphicsMagick and
 ImageMagick can be used in parallel. Install package
 graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat to obtain a set of several executables
 that is compatible to ImageMagick's interface.

Package: graphicsmagick-dbg
Description-md5: fcc436d75960b67f4f57213c969230ff
Description-en: format-independent image processing - debugging symbols
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for the gm executable as well as the
 C, C++, and Perl bindings. Tools like gdb and ltrace make use of these
 symbols.

 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick libraries are a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offer
 programming interfaces that are mostly compatible. While there might be
 small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible
 subset and build fine with either GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick.
 .
 While GraphicsMagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and
 helper applications in order to coexist with ImageMagick, this package
 intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the GraphicsMagick
 interface with the usual ImageMagick names. Note that this package only
 tries to provide build-time compatibility. Run-time libraries of
 ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are incompatible and cannot be interchanged.
 .
 This package includes compatibility wrappers for the C, C++, and Perl
 libraries.

Package: libfuzzer-12-dev
Description-md5: bc55cd127b8dab148b78e61e5e475b8e
Description-en: Library for coverage-guided fuzz testing
 LibFuzzer is a library for in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing
 of other libraries.
 .
 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

Package: libgraphics-magick-perl
Description-md5: 694d24fef1105bb316b3f9173117fd3c
Description-en: format-independent image processing - perl interface
 GraphicsMagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.
 .
 This package contains the classes to access GraphicsMagick functionality from
 Perl scripts. It is mostly similar to PerlMagick from the ImageMagick suite,
 but uses a different class name.

 write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
 widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
 image formats found on some photo CDs. There are functions for finegrained
 image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
 image formats.
 .
 The GraphicsMagick library is a fork of ImageMagick and therefore offers
 an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
 across releases. While compatibility does not go so far that the
 GraphicsMagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for ImageMagick,
 conversion can usually be done with little effort.
 .
 This package contains the C++ libraries needed to run executables that use
 the GraphicsMagick++ library.

Package: libhtml-stripscripts-perl
Description-md5: 5630c87178afcfe3f49d16005cba6177
Description-en: module for removing scripts from HTML
 HTML::StripScripts is a Perl module for neutralizes scripting constructs in
 HTML, leaving as much non-scripting markup in place as possible. This allows
 web applications to display HTML originating from an untrusted source without
 introducing cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
 .
 The process is based on whitelists of tags, attributes and attribute values.
 This approach is the most secure against disguised scripting constructs hidden
 in malicious HTML documents.
 .
 As well as removing scripting constructs, this module ensures that there is a
 matching end for each start tag, and that the tags are properly nested.
 .
 You will probably use HTML::StripScripts::Parser rather than using this module
 directly (see libhtml-stripscripts-parser-perl).

 statements are output at arbitrary granularity.
 .
 Log4j can output to: a file, a rolling file, a database with a JDBC driver,
 many output  asynchronously, a JMS Topic, a swing based logging console,
 the NT event log, /dev/null, a SMTP server (using javamail), a socket server,
 syslog, telnet daemon and stdout.

Description-en: Apache Log4j - Logging Framework for Java
 Apache Log4j 2 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements
 over its predecessor, Log4j 1.x:
 .
 API Separation: The API for Log4j is separate from the implementation making
 it clear for application developers which classes and methods they can use
 while ensuring forward compatibility.
 .
 Improved Performance: Log4j 2 contains next-generation Asynchronous Loggers
 based on the LMAX Disruptor library. In multi-threaded scenarios Asynchronous
 Loggers have 10 times higher throughput and orders of magnitude lower latency
 than Log4j 1.x.
 .
 Support for multiple APIs: While the Log4j 2 API will provide the best
 performance, Log4j 2 provides support for the SLF4J and Commons Logging APIs.
 .
 Automatic Reloading of Configurations: Log4j 2 can automatically reload its
 configuration upon modification. It will do so without losing log events
 while reconfiguration is taking place.
 .
 Advanced Filtering: Log4j 2 supports filtering based on context
 data, markers, regular expressions, and other components in the Log event.
 Filtering can be specified to apply to all events before being passed to
 Loggers or as they pass through Appenders.
 .
 Plugin Architecture: Log4j uses the plugin pattern to configure components.
 As such, no code is needed to create and configure an Appender, Layout,
 Pattern Converter, and so on. Log4j automatically recognizes plugins
 and uses them when a configuration references them.
 .
 Property Support: Properties can be referenced in a configuration, Log4j will
 directly replace them, or Log4j will pass them to an underlying component that
 will dynamically resolve them. Properties come from values defined in the
 configuration file, system properties, environment variables, the
 ThreadContext Map, and data present in the event.

Description-en: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
 .
 This package contains the development files.

    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").

Description-en: FFmpeg library for image scaling and various conversions - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized image scaling and colorspace and pixel
 format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Rescaling is the process of changing the video size. Several rescaling
    options and algorithms are available. This is usually a lossy process.
  * Pixel format conversion is the process of converting the image format and
    colorspace of the image, for example from planar YUV420P to RGB24 packed.
    It also handles packing conversion, that is converts from packed layout
    (all pixels belonging to distinct planes interleaved in the same buffer),
    to planar layout (all samples belonging to the same plane stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane"). This is usually a lossy process in case the
    source and destination colorspaces differ.

Description-md5: 4412c81ce6b855cdb9e1ccd39b88a1c5
Description-en: Library that handles the userspace side of the LIO TCM-User backstore
 LIO is the SCSI target in the Linux kernel. It is entirely kernel
 code, and allows exported SCSI logical units (LUNs) to be backed by
 regular files or block devices. But, if one want to get fancier with
 the capabilities of the device one is emulating, the kernel is not
 necessarily the right place. While there are userspace libraries for
 compression, encryption, and clustered storage solutions like Ceph or
 Gluster, these are not accessible from the kernel.
 .
 The TCMU userspace-passthrough backstore allows a userspace process
 to handle requests to a LUN. But since the kernel-user interface that
 TCMU provides must be fast and flexible, it is complex enough that
 one would like to avoid each userspace handler having to write boilerplate
 code.
 .
 tcmu-runner handles the messy details of the TCMU interface -- UIO,
 netlink, pthreads, and DBus -- and exports a more friendly C plugin
 module API. Modules using this API are called "TCMU
 handlers". Handler authors can write code just to handle the SCSI
 commands as desired, and can also link with whatever userspace
 libraries they like.
 .
 This is the library package

Package: libxstream-java
Description-md5: 10c1dedc8716f96d83e51d094ab4032b
Description-en: Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again
 The features of the XStream library are:
 .
  - Ease of use. A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common
    use cases.
  - No mappings required. Most objects can be serialized without need
    for specifying mappings.
  - Performance. Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of
    the design, making it suitable for large object graphs or systems
    with high message throughput.
  - Clean XML. No information is duplicated that can be obtained via
    reflection. This results in XML that is easier to read for humans
    and more compact than native Java serialization.
  - Requires no modifications to objects. Serializes internal fields,
    including private and final. Supports non-public and inner classes.
    Classes are not required to have default constructor.
  - Full object graph support. Duplicate references encountered in the
    object-model will be maintained. Supports circular references.
  - Integrates with other XML APIs. By implementing an interface,
    XStream can serialize directly to/from any tree structure (not just
    XML).
  - Customizable conversion strategies. Strategies can be registered
    allowing customization of how particular types are represented as
    XML.
  - Error messages. When an exception occurs due to malformed XML,
    detailed diagnostics are provided to help isolate and fix the
    problem.

Package: lime-forensics-dkms
Description-md5: cb370b8d5216a7ee6a5025cd0a804f1f
Description-en: kernel module to memory dump (DKMS)
 LiME (Linux Memory Extractor, formerly DMD) is a Loadable Kernel
 Module (LKM), which allows the acquisition of volatile memory (RAM)
 from Linux and Linux-based devices, such as those powered by Android.
 In others words, you can use it to get a memory image from a machine.
 .
 The tool supports acquiring memory either to the file system of the
 device or over the network. LiME is unique in that it is the first
 tool that allows full memory captures from Android devices. It also
 minimizes its interaction between user and kernel space processes
 during acquisition. It will produce memory captures that are more
 forensically sound than those of other tools designed for Linux
 memory acquisition. The dump format provided as "lime" is fully
 compatible with volatility framework.
 .
 This package provides the source code for the lime-forensics kernel
 modules to be build with dkms.
 .
 Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.

Description-md5: 3678f13807c05861be8c708a652e8e9d
Description-en: Precision Time Protocol (PTP, IEEE1588) implementation for Linux
 Linuxptp is an implementation of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
 according to IEEE standard 1588 for Linux. Features include:
  - support for hardware and software time stamping via the Linux
    SO_TIMESTAMPING socket option.
  - support for the Linux PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) subsystem by using the
    clock_gettime family of calls, including the new clock_adjtimex
    system call
  - implementation of Boundary Clock (BC) and Ordinary Clock (OC)
  - transport over UDP/IPv4, UDP/IPv6, and raw Ethernet (Layer 2)
  - support for IEEE 802.1AS-2011 in the role of end station
 .
 PTP provides higher precision and faster synchronization than NTP even
 without hardware support. With hardware support, sub-microsecond
 accuracy can be expected. Whereas NTP is intended for WAN use, PTP is
 designed for LAN environments and makes use of UDP multicast.

Package: llvm-12
Description-md5: 07d463911771b9679a5f0131f40992d4
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X96, SparcV10, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description-en: Mender over-the-air software updater client.
 Mender: over-the-air updater for embedded Linux devices
 .
 Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded
 Linux devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as
 well as a server that manages deployments across many devices.
 .
 Embedded product teams often end up creating homegrown updaters
 at the last minute due to the need to fix bugs in field-deployed
 devices. However, the most important requirement for an embedded update
 process is robustness, for example loss of power at any time should not
 brick a device. This creates a challenge given the time constraints to
 develop and maintain a homegrown updater.
 .
 Mender aims to address this challenge with a robust and easy to use
 updater for embedded Linux devices, which is open source and available
 to anyone.
 .
 Robustness is ensured with atomic image-based deployments using a dual
 A/B rootfs partition layout. This makes it always possible to roll
 back to a working state, even when losing power at any time during the
 update process.
 .
 Ease of use is addressed with an intuitive UI, comprehensive documentation
 (https://docs.mender.io/), a meta layer for the Yocto Project
 (https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender) for easy integration
 into existing environments, and high quality software (see the test
 coverage badge).
 .
 This repository contains the Mender client updater, which can be run in
 standalone mode (manually triggered through its command line interface)
 or managed mode (connected to the Mender server).
 .
 Mender not only provides the client-side updater, but also the backend and
 UI for managing deployments as open source. The Mender server is designed
 as a microservices architecture and comprises several repositories.
 .
 To start using Mender, we recommend that you begin with the Getting
 started section in the Mender documentation (https://docs.mender.io/).
 .
 In order to support rollback, the Mender client depends on integration
 with U-Boot and the partition layout. It is therefore most easily
 built as part of your Yocto Project image by using the meta layer for
 the Yocto Project (https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender).

 Network Block Device (NBD) is a client/server protocol that
 emulates a block device (such as a hard disk, a floppy, or a CD-ROM)
 over the network, thus giving the system the ability to swap over the
 network, or to use raw network disk space for other purposes.

Description-en: NCBI Entrez utilities on the command line
 Entrez Direct (EDirect) is an advanced method for accessing NCBI's set
 of interconnected databases (publication, sequence, structure, gene,
 variation, expression, etc.) from a terminal window or script.
 Functions take search terms from command-line arguments.  Individual
 operations are combined to build multi-step queries.  Record retrieval
 and formatting normally complete the process.
 .
 EDirect also provides an argument-driven function that simplifies the
 extraction of data from document summaries or other results that are
 returned in structured XML format.  This can eliminate the need for
 writing custom software to answer ad hoc questions.  Queries can move
 seamlessly between EDirect commands and UNIX utilities or scripts to
 perform actions that cannot be accomplished entirely within Entrez.

Description-md5: 97fd17b58309e4239a6c5b4052035526
Description-en: JSON for the ES5 era
 JSON5 is a proposed extension to JSON that aims to make it easier for
 humans to write and maintain by hand. It does this by adding some
 minimal syntax features directly from ECMAScript 5.
 .
 JSON5 remains a strict subset of JavaScript, adds no new data types,
 and works with all existing JSON content.
 .
 JSON5 is not an official successor to JSON, and JSON5 content may not
 work with existing JSON parsers. For this reason, JSON5 files use a
 new .json5 extension. (TODO: new MIME type needed too.)
 .
 The code here is a reference JavaScript implementation for both Node.js
 and all browsers. It’s based directly off of Douglas Crockford’s own
 JSON implementation, and it’s both robust and secure.

 Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot
 of the functional programming support that you would expect in
 Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in
 JavaScript objects.  It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux.
 .
 Underscore provides 60-odd functions that support both the usual
 functional suspects: map, select, invoke - as well as more specialized
 helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality
 testing, and so on.  It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so
 modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map,
 reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.

Package: node-url-parse
Description-md5: 0e27d3fc10c5e075495ca0ecf3279b9f
Description-en: Parse URL in node using the URL module and in the browser using the DOM
 The url-parse method exposes two different API interfaces. The url interface
 that you know from Node.js and the new URL interface that is available in
 the latest browsers.
 .
 Since 0.1 we've moved away from using the DOM's <a> element for URL parsing
 and moving to a full Regular Expression solution. The main reason for this
 change is to make the URL parser available in different JavaScript
 environments as you don't always have access to the DOM like Worker
 environments.  This module still have a really small foot print as this
 module's main intention is to be bundled with client-side code. The only
 problem however with a RegExp based solution is that it required a lot of
 lookups causing major problems in FireFox. So the last and the current
 solution was a pure string parsing solution which chops up the URL in
 smaller pieces.

Package: notary
Description-md5: e711f233992770c0982664a996c25313
Description-en: tool for running and interacting with trusted collections
 Notary is a project that allows anyone to have trust over arbitrary
 collections of data.
 .
 The Notary project comprises a server (cmd/notary-server) and a client
 (cmd/notary) for running and interacting with trusted collections.
 .
 Notary aims to make the internet more secure by making it easy for people to
 publish and verify content. We often rely on TLS to secure our communications
 with a web server which is inherently flawed, as any compromise of the server
 enables malicious content to be substituted for the legitimate content.
 .
 With Notary, publishers can sign their content offline using keys kept highly
 secure. Once the publisher is ready to make the content available, they can
 push their signed trusted collection to a Notary Server.
 .
 Consumers, having acquired the publisher's public key through a secure
 channel, can then communicate with any notary server or (insecure) mirror,
 relying only on the publisher's key to determine the validity and integrity
 of the received content.
 .
 This package contains the binaries/tools.

Description-md5: af28805f94a51eaf0ac0775f9fa23601
Description-en: Milter implementation of DMARC
 Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC),
 builds on the successes of technologies such as DomainKeys Identified Mail
 (DKIM) and the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to create an infrastructure that
 enforces policy on domain names that are visible to end users, and creates a
 feedback framework for identifying and tracking fraudulent use of domain
 names in email.  It uses OpenDBX as an interface layer to various SQL back
 ends.
 .
 It provides the following new capabilities:
 .
 A binding between the domain name seen in the From: field of a message and
 one or both of the domain names verified by DKIM and SPF;
 .
 The capability to request that receivers enforce strict message
 authentication policy published by the author; and Comprehensive reporting,
 both forensic and aggregate, regarding suspect messages.
 .
 This package contains the OpenDMARC mail filter (Milter) for plugging into
 Milter-aware MTAs. It implements support for both message reject and DMARC
 failure reporting.
 .
 It also provides various example scripts which can be used for enhancing
 opendmarc.

Description-en: command-line tools for the OpenEXR image format
 OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by
 Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.
 .
 OpenEXR's features include:
    * Higher dynamic range and colour precision than existing 8- and
      10-bit image file formats.
    * Support for the "half" 16-bit floating-point pixel format.
    * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the
      included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on
      images with film grain.
    * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily
      be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR
      software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors,
      integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without
      affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR
      applications.
 .
 This package contains the following tools:
    * exrheader, a utility for dumping header information.
    * exrstdattr, a utility for modifying OpenEXR standard attributes.

 This package supports using the Dockerfile syntax to build OCI & Docker
 compatible images, without invoking a container build command such
 as buildah bud or docker build. It is intended to give clients more
 control over how they build container images, including:
  - Instead of building one layer per line, run all instructions in the
    same container
  - Set HostConfig settings like network and memory controls that are
    not available when running container builds
  - Mount external files into the build that are not persisted as part
    of the final image (i.e. "secrets")
  - If there are no RUN commands in the Dockerfile, the container is
    created and committed, but never started.  The final image should be
    99.9% compatible with regular container builds, but bugs are always
    possible.

 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

Package: reposurgeon
Description-md5: a8314666f689b6a68559123cd1263bfa
Description-en: Tool for editing version-control repository history
 `reposurgeon` enables risky operations that version-control systems
 don't want to let you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata,
 (b) excising commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files and
 subtrees from repo history. The original motivation for `reposurgeon`
 was to clean up artifacts created by repository conversions.
 .
 `reposurgeon` is also useful for scripting very high-quality
 conversions from Subversion.  It is better than `git-svn` at tag
 lifting, automatically cleaning up `cvs2svn` conversion artifacts,
 dealing with nonstandard repository layouts, recognizing branch
 merges, handling mixed-branch commits, and generally at coping with
 Subversion's many odd corner cases.  Normally Subversion repos should
 be analyzed at a rate of upwards of ten thousand commits per minute,
 though that rate can fall significantly on extremely large
 repositories.
 .
 Another auxiliary program, `repotool`, performs various useful
 operations such as checkouts and tag listing in a VCS-independent
 manner.  Yet another, `repomapper`, assists in automatically preparing
 contributor maps of CVS and SVN repositories.
 .
 The `repocutter` program is available for some specialized operations on
 Subversion dumpfiles; it may be useful in extracting portions of
 particularly gnarly Subversion repositories for conversion witth
 reposurgeon.
 .
 This distribution supports a generic conversion workflow using these
 tools, and includes the DVCS Migration Guide that describes how to use it.

Package: ripgrep
Description-md5: 036cda5b7b984beae7aa99e9d0ade58f
Description-en: Recursively searches directories for a regex pattern
 ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current
 directory for a regex pattern while respecting your gitignore rules and
 automatically skip hidden files/directories (smart filtering) and binary files.
 ripgrep is similar to other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack
 and grep.
 .
 ripgrep is generally faster than both The Silver Searcher and GNU grep. It
 defaults to recursive directory search and won't search files ignored by your
 `.gitignore` files. Use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
 bugs, and Unicode support.
 .
 On the other hand, if you like multiline search, then ripgrep may not quite
 meet your needs (yet), and it will never support fancy regex features such as
 backreferences or lookaround

  * managing a magazine type site i.e. made up mainly of
    articles and news items inserted in an arborescence
    of sections nested in each others.
  * completely separating and distributing three kinds of tasks
    over various players: the graphic design, the site editorial
    input through the submission of articles and news items and
    the site editorial management.
  * spare the webmaster and all the participants to the life of
    the site, a number of tedious aspects of web publishing as
    well as the need to learn lengthy technical skills.
    SPIP allows you to start creating your sections and
    articles straight away.

Package: tcmu-runner
Description-md5: 145e597bb8213f857ae5d54f860956e6
Description-en: Daemon that handles the userspace side of the LIO TCM-User backstore
 LIO is the SCSI target in the Linux kernel. It is entirely kernel
 code, and allows exported SCSI logical units (LUNs) to be backed by
 regular files or block devices. But, if one want to get fancier with
 the capabilities of the device one is emulating, the kernel is not
 necessarily the right place. While there are userspace libraries for
 compression, encryption, and clustered storage solutions like Ceph or
 Gluster, these are not accessible from the kernel.
 .
 The TCMU userspace-passthrough backstore allows a userspace process
 to handle requests to a LUN. But since the kernel-user interface that
 TCMU provides must be fast and flexible, it is complex enough that
 one would like to avoid each userspace handler having to write boilerplate
 code.
 .
 tcmu-runner handles the messy details of the TCMU interface -- UIO,
 netlink, pthreads, and DBus -- and exports a more friendly C plugin
 module API. Modules using this API are called "TCMU
 handlers". Handler authors can write code just to handle the SCSI
 commands as desired, and can also link with whatever userspace
 libraries they like.
 .
 This is the daemon package

Package: xterm
Description-md5: c1e47d60a01948be9aae7a2a4f63a0fe
Description-en: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Package: xvfb
Description-md5: 1cd5b85acd06c23d376b7b5a7f30a0b8
Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.
 .
 More information about X.Org can be found at:
 <URL:https://www.x.org>
 .
 This package is built from the X.org xserver module.

Package: xzdec
Description-md5: 30227ffce3f42144b3b624776f996bbf
Description-en: XZ-format compression utilities - tiny decompressors
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the xzdec and lzmadec utilities, which write
 the decompressed version of a compressed file to standard output. The
 binaries are very small, so they can be easily stored on small media
 with some compressed files, and they are linked statically against
 liblzma so they can be used on machines without a compatible version
 of liblzma installed. However, they have:
 .
   * no compression support;
   * no support for writing to a file other than standard output;
   * no translated messages;
   * been optimized for size rather than speed.
 .
 For a full-featured xzcat command without these limitations, use
 the xz-utils package instead.
