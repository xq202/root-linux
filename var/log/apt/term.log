YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THE ENTIRE FOLLOWING LICENSE AGREEMENT BEFORE
INSTALLING THIS SOFTWARE PROGRAM.   THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS IMPORTANT TERMS
THAT AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.  BY INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE PROGRAM, YOU AGREE
TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS
OF THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL THIS SOFTWARE PROGRAM.

The software application(s) (the “Program”) is the copyrighted work of
Valve Corporation (“Valve”) or its suppliers.  All rights reserved, except
as expressly stated herein.  The Program is provided solely for installation by
end users according to the terms of this License Agreement, except as provided
below regarding permitted redistributions. All use of the Program is governed
by the terms of the Steam subscriber agreement located at
www.steampowered.com/agreement (the “Steam Agreement”), as such terms may
be updated from time to time, which terms are incorporated into this License
Agreement by this reference. Any use, reproduction or redistribution of the
Program not in accordance with the terms of the License Agreement and the Steam
[More] 

Agreement is expressly prohibited.

LICENSE AGREEMENT

1.    Grant of Licenses.

A. Personal Use Limited Installation License. Valve hereby grants, and by
installing the Program you thereby accept, a limited, non-exclusive license and
right to install copies of the Program on each of your computers solely for
your personal use.

B. Limited Redistribution License.  Valve hereby grants, and you accept, a
limited, terminable, non-exclusive license to reproduce and distribute an
unlimited number of copies of the Program; provided that the following
conditions are met: (i) you must distribute the Program in its entirety;

(ii) you may not modify the Program, except that, in the case of the Linux
version of the Program, you may modify scripts and other documentary and
graphical files, but not any files containing the term “bootstrap” in the
file name, provided that you do not modify any icons, change any copyright or
other notices, or alter this or any other license agreement that is included
[More] 

with the Program, and provided further that any modifications you make are
identified by you as modifications from the original Program provided by Valve;

(iii) you may repackage the Program and distribute it with another software
program, provided that you do not integrate the Program in any way with that
other software program, or combine the Program with that other software program
in a manner that would require you to distribute the Program under any open
source or other license terms different from these terms.

(iv) you may not charge any separate fee or receive any compensation
attributable to the Program;

(v) you must include this License Agreement provided with the Program and
ensure that it will display and be required to be accepted by the end user in
the same manner as is required by the Program in the form received by you; and

(vi) you must preserve in all copies of the Program all copyright and legal
notices that are attached to the copy of the Program received by you.

C.    Restrictions/Reservation of Rights.  Except as expressly set forth
elsewhere in this License Agreement, you may not, in whole or in part: copy,
[More] 

photocopy, reproduce, translate, reverse engineer (with the exception of
specific circumstances where such act is permitted by law), derive source code
from, modify, disassemble, decompile, or create derivative works based on the
Program; remove any proprietary notices or labels on the Program; or attempt in
any manner to circumvent any security measures designed to control access to
the Program. You may not package the Program with, or pre-install the Program
on, any hardware, without obtaining a separate license from us.  The Program is
licensed to you as a single product. Its component parts may not be separated
for use on more than one computer.  You may not sell, grant a security interest
in, rent, lease or license the Program to others without the prior written
consent of Valve. The Program is licensed, not sold. Your license confers no
title or ownership in the Program or copies thereof.

2.      Ownership. All title, ownership rights and intellectual property rights
in and to the Program and any and all copies thereof (including but not limited
to any titles, computer code, themes, objects, characters, character names,
stories, dialog, catch phrases, locations, concepts, artwork, animations,
sounds, musical compositions, audio-visual effects, methods of operation, moral
rights, any related documentation, and “applets” incorporated into the
Program) are owned by Valve or its licensors.  The Program is protected by the
copyright laws of the United States, international copyright treaties and
[More] 

conventions and other laws. All rights are reserved. The Program contains
certain licensed materials and Valve’s licensors may protect their rights in
the event of any violation of this Agreement.

3.     Termination. This License Agreement is effective until terminated. You
may terminate the License Agreement at any time by destroying the Program.  We
may terminate your rights set forth in Section 1.B. of this License Agreement
at any time upon notice to you.  This License Agreement shall automatically
terminate in the event that you fail to comply with the terms and conditions
contained herein. In such event, you must immediately destroy the Program.  The
provisions of Sections 2, 3, and 5-7 will survive any termination of the
Agreement.

4.     Export Controls. The Program may not be re-exported, downloaded or
otherwise exported into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which
the U.S. has embargoed goods, or to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s
list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department’s
Table of Denial Orders. By installing the Program, you are agreeing to the
foregoing and you are representing and warranting that you are not located in,
under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any
such list.

5.     WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; NO GUARANTEES. 
DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THE STEAM
AGREEMENT, AND/OR ELSEWHERE IN THE STEAM AGREEMENT, APPLY TO YOUR USE OF THE
PROGRAM.  AS NOTED IN THE STEAM AGREEMENT, FOR EU CUSTOMERS, SUCH PROVISIONS DO
NOT REDUCE YOUR MANDATORY CONSUMERS’ RIGHTS UNDER THE LAWS OF YOUR LOCAL
JURISDICTION.

6.    Warranties/Indemnities Relating to Redistribution.  If you choose to
redistribute the Program, you represent and warrant that any modifications you
make to the Program, if any, and your particular combination of the Program
with any other software or hardware, do not infringe on any third-party
intellectual property rights.  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Valve, its licensors, and its and their affiliates from all liabilities, claims
and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, that arise from or in connection
with your redistribution of any modifications you make to the Program or your
particular combination of the Program with any other software or hardware or
your breach of this License Agreement.  Valve reserves the right, at its own
expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise
subject to indemnification by you. In that event, you shall have no further
obligation to provide indemnification to Valve in that matter.

7.    Miscellaneous. Provisions relating to applicable law and jurisdiction,
and dispute resolution, set forth in the Steam Agreement shall apply to any
